Use the supplied .java file(s) as the basis of your solution to the assignment. Note that, for the purposes of this course, all classes are defined within the default package (in other words, they do not explicitly specify a package).

This assignment must be submitted as a .zip file containing only your solution's .java files named following the convention LastnameFirstInitialExercise#.zip where the '#' is the Exercise number.
For example, my submission for this assignment would be named DukeGExercise9.3.zip). There should be NO DIRECTORIES within the zip file.

Inclusion of the System.exit() method in your code negatively impacts the operation of the test suite and will result in a loss of credit. DO NOT use the System.exit() method in your solution.

In addition to the usual template code (BasePlusCommissionEmployeeComposition.java) and a CommissionEmployee.jar file (add this as a Library on your Java Build Path so you don't have to retype CommissionEmployee.java from the book), a unit test driver that bears a striking resemblance to the one I'll use to grade your assignment has also been made available as a .jar file. Please use that to check your assumptions and validate your work.
Your assignment submission should contain only BasePlusCommissionEmployeeComposition.java.

You won't be developing a main method for this assignment, so your class won't do much (anything) on its own. Don't worry… the unit tests will put it through its paces.

The BasePlusCommissionEmployeeComposition toString method should return a String in the format demonstrated below:
base-salaried commission employee: John Doe
social security number: 111-22-3333
gross sales: 444.55
commission rate: 0.10
base salary: 200.00
