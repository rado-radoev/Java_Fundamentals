Use the supplied .java file(s) as the basis of your solution to the assignment. Note that, for the purposes of this course, all classes are defined within the default package (in other words, they do not explicitly specify a package).

This assignment must be submitted as a .zip file containing only your solution's .java files named following the convention LastnameFirstInitialExercise#.zip where the '#' is the Exercise number.
For example, my submission for this assignment would be named DukeGExercise4.19.zip). There should be no directories within the zip file.

Ensure that your program's output follows the format of the sample that follows. Consistent formatting, naming, spelling, etc. is necessary to support the automated testing. *Slight* rounding errors in the numeric values will be accounted for. Note that the test suite may provide different inputs when validating your solution.
